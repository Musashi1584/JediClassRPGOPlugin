[h1]RPG Overhaul - Jedi Specializations[/h1]

This plugin transforms the Jedi Class into 3 RPGO Specializations.
If you are still getting soldiers promoted to the Jedi class with this plugin active 
use the mod "Disable any class" and disable the Jedi class in its MCM options.

[h1]IMPORTANT NEW PLUGIN MECHANIC[/h1]
In order to gain access to any jedi specializations you NEED to have the squaddie perk "Force User" on your soldier.
Soldiers WITHOUT this perk CANNOT get jedi specs by default, random or with commanders choice.
